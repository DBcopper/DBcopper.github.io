Introduction
---
The aim of this project is to use an improved Faster-RCNN object detection algorithm in field conditions to detect dragon fruit at different growth stages (including buds, flowers, immature, half-ripe, and ripe) and provide a basis for subsequent target tracking tasks. By counting the number of dragon fruit at each growth stage, this project can help farmers develop more accurate planting plans.
