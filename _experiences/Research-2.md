As a research assistant supervised by [Assoc. Prof. Li](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Xiuhua-Li-2) and [Prof. Goh](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Hui-Hwang-Goh), I mainly worked on computer vision projects in the ACIP laboratory. I extensively read research papers from top conferences such as CVPR, ICCV, NIPS, and ECCV, and wrote comprehensive reviews on large-scale and multimodal models, including the Diffusion model, Stable diffusion model, Dall E2, Clip, and GPT-3. Additionally, I proposed a novel image generation method based on the diffusion model.
