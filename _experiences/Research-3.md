I was primarily responsible for the research and development of projects related to smart agriculture, supervised by [Assoc. Prof. Li](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Xiuhua-Li-2) and [Prof. Zhang](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Mu-Qing-Zhang)ï¼Œ The scope of my work included crop disease diagnosis, crop disease image generation, remote sensing image segmentation, reconstruction and segmentation of crop 3D point clouds, as well as the extraction of related phenotypes. As a research assistant, I was responsible for conducting preliminary research, extracting innovative ideas, building models, software development, and final deployment. I have extensive experience with programming languages such as Python, C++, Java, JavaScript, Node.js, git, linux and MySQL, as well as frameworks such as Pytorch, Vue, and Express. Detailed information about my research experience can be found in the projects I have worked on.
